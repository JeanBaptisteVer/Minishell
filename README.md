## 💡 About the project

	🚀 Minishell was a collaborative effort at School 42 in Paris. In this project, we aimed to create a simple shell, which provided us with valuable hands-on experience in processes and file descriptors. Our task involved building a fully functional shell with features such as prompt display, command history, redirections, and pipes. We also learned how to interpret environment variables and implement built-in commands.

## Built-ins Implemented

In our Minishell project, we've successfully implemented the following built-in commands:

- `echo`: Supports the `-n` option.
- `cd`: Allows for changing the current working directory using relative or absolute paths.
- `pwd`: Displays the current working directory.
- `export`: Manages environment variables without any options.
- `unset`: Removes environment variables without any options.
- `env`: Displays the environment variables or arguments.
- `exit`: Exits the shell without any options.
